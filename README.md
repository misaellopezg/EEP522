# EEP522
Repository for EEP522 Embedded and Real Time Systems

## General Information
This respository contains assignments A1, A2, and A3 for EEP522. 
* A1 contains source code dealing with the configuration of the target board (Raspberry Pi 4). 
* A2 contains source code dealing with the characterization of the board with respect to the final project (or general exploration of the board). 
* A3 contains the source code for the final project. The final project utilizes the findings of assignments A1 and A2. 

The final project presented for this class is a self-balancing robot prototype. The following components were used to realize the prototype: 
* MPU6050 Accel./Gyroscope
* BSS138 Logic Level Shifter
* L298N Dual H-Bridge
* 6V Micro-gear DC Motors
